# tik-tac-toe game
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game implemented in Python. The project allows players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
